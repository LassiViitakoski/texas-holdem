# Texas Hold'em Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: Architecture document available at `docs/architecture.md` (completed document-project analysis)

**Current Project State**: 
Texas Hold'em is a real-time multiplayer poker platform built as a microservices monorepo using modern TypeScript technologies. The system separates concerns into three main applications (React client, Fastify API server, real-time game server) with shared packages, emphasizing real-time game synchronization and precise monetary calculations.

## Available Documentation Analysis

✅ **Using existing project analysis from document-project output**

Key documents available:
- ✅ **Tech Stack Documentation** - Complete technology stack with versions documented
- ✅ **Source Tree/Architecture** - Comprehensive module organization and structure
- ✅ **API Documentation** - Available in `apps/api-server/routes.md`
- ✅ **External API Documentation** - Socket.io events and Redis pub/sub patterns documented
- ✅ **Technical Debt Documentation** - Known issues and workarounds clearly identified
- ✅ **Coding Standards** - TypeScript patterns and architectural principles established

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **Bug Fix and Stability Improvements** + **Core Feature Completion**

**Enhancement Description**: Complete and stabilize the basic Texas Hold'em cash game implementation by first conducting comprehensive testing to assess current functionality status, then addressing identified gaps in both game server logic and frontend state management. Based on findings, migrate from TanStack Store to Zustand, restructure state architecture, and ensure reliable game logic execution with proper UI synchronization.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Significant Impact** - Core functionality fixes affecting game logic, state management architecture, and real-time UI synchronization

## Original Product Vision

**Core Product Purpose**: 
Create a Texas Hold'em poker game where people can play against each other online with real money (fake money at proof of concept version).

**Current Product Requirements**:
- Poker game available for people at web browser
- Users required to sign in/register to be able to play games
- Users can sit down on tables if there is room on table
- Users can also create new tables if there is no room at current tables
- Users can deposit money to be able to play (fake money at proof of concept version)
- Users can only play cash game version of Texas Hold'em at first release of service

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
1. ✅ **Conduct comprehensive testing and review of current application state**
2. ✅ **Document what functionality is working vs. what needs improvement**
3. ✅ **Validate current game flow and identify specific UI synchronization gaps**
4. ✅ Game server correctly determines round winners and distributes pots
5. ✅ Client UI accurately reflects all game state changes in real-time  
6. ✅ **Migrate from TanStack Store to Zustand for improved state management**
7. ✅ **Restructure frontend state architecture for better game synchronization**
8. ✅ Players can complete full poker rounds without UI/logic desynchronization
9. ✅ All basic poker actions (fold, call, raise, check) work reliably
10. ✅ Round transitions (preflop → flop → turn → river → showdown) function correctly

**Background Context:**
The Texas Hold'em platform has solid architectural foundation with real-time WebSocket communication, but the basic cash game functionality has implementation gaps. Game server logic may execute correctly but UI synchronization is unreliable, creating poor user experience. This foundational work is prerequisite for any advanced features like tournaments or real money integration.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall provide comprehensive testing capabilities to assess current application functionality status, including user flows, game logic execution, and UI synchronization behavior.

**FR2**: The frontend shall migrate from TanStack Store to Zustand state management library while maintaining all existing functionality during transition.

**FR3**: The system shall restructure frontend state architecture to improve real-time synchronization between game server events and client UI updates.

**FR4**: The game server shall correctly execute complete poker rounds from preflop through showdown, accurately determining winners and distributing pots according to Texas Hold'em rules.

**FR5**: The client UI shall accurately reflect all game state changes in real-time, including player actions, community cards, betting rounds, and pot updates without synchronization delays or inconsistencies.

**FR6**: Players shall be able to execute all basic poker actions (fold, call, raise, check) reliably with immediate UI feedback and proper validation.

**FR7**: The system shall handle round transitions (preflop → flop → turn → river → showdown) seamlessly with proper state synchronization across all connected clients.

**FR8**: The application shall maintain existing user authentication, game creation/joining, and table management functionality throughout the enhancement process.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The state management migration shall maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 15%.

**NFR2**: Real-time UI updates shall occur within 100ms of game server state changes to ensure responsive gameplay experience.

**NFR3**: The system shall handle concurrent player actions gracefully without race conditions or state corruption during high-activity periods.

**NFR4**: All existing WebSocket communication patterns shall remain functional during the frontend state restructuring process.

**NFR5**: The enhanced system shall support the same number of concurrent games and players as the current implementation without performance degradation.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: API compatibility shall be maintained - all existing HTTP endpoints and WebSocket events must continue to function without breaking changes.

**CR2**: Database schema compatibility shall be preserved - no database migrations or schema changes are required for this enhancement.

**CR3**: UI/UX consistency shall be maintained - visual design and user interaction patterns must remain unchanged during state management migration.

**CR4**: Integration compatibility shall be ensured - Redis pub/sub messaging and inter-service communication must continue to operate without modification.

## Epic and Story Structure

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Epic Approach** - All work addresses the same core issue (unreliable cash game foundation) and components have strong dependencies requiring coordinated development.
