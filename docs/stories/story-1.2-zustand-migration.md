# Story 1.2: Zustand State Management Migration

**Epic**: Epic 1: Cash Game Foundation Stabilization

## User Story
As a Frontend Developer,
I want to migrate from TanStack Store to Zustand,
so that state management becomes more reliable and easier to debug for game synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Install Zustand and create new store structure based on existing gameStore patterns
2. Implement parallel state management during transition period
3. Migrate all game-related state operations to Zustand stores
4. Remove TanStack Store dependencies once migration is complete
5. Verify no performance regression compared to baseline

## Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing UI components continue to receive correct state updates
- IV2: WebSocket event handling maintains real-time synchronization
- IV3: Memory usage stays within acceptable limits (â‰¤15% increase)

## Story Status
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Assigned**: Unassigned
- **Story Points**: TBD
- **Priority**: High
