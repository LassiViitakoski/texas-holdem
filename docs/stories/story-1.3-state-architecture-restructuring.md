# Story 1.3: Frontend State Architecture Restructuring

**Epic**: Epic 1: Cash Game Foundation Stabilization

## User Story
As a Frontend Developer,
I want to restructure the state architecture for better game synchronization,
so that UI updates reliably reflect server state changes without delays or inconsistencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Design new state structure optimized for real-time poker game updates
2. Implement proper state normalization for game entities (players, rounds, actions)
3. Create efficient update patterns for high-frequency game events
4. Add state validation and error recovery mechanisms
5. Test state consistency across multiple concurrent user sessions

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Socket.io event handlers properly update restructured state
- IV2: UI components render correctly with new state structure
- IV3: State changes propagate consistently across all game components

## Story Status
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Assigned**: Unassigned
- **Story Points**: TBD
- **Priority**: High
