# Story 1.4: Game Server Logic Completion & Debugging

**Epic**: Epic 1: Cash Game Foundation Stabilization

## User Story
As a Game Developer,
I want to complete and debug the core poker game logic,
so that rounds execute correctly from preflop through showdown with accurate winner determination.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Debug and fix round progression logic (preflop → flop → turn → river → showdown)
2. Ensure accurate pot calculation and distribution to winners
3. Validate all poker action handling (fold, call, raise, check) with proper constraints
4. Implement proper dealer button rotation and blind collection
5. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases and invalid actions

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Database transactions properly persist all game state changes
- IV2: WebSocket events broadcast correct game updates to all clients
- IV3: Game logic handles concurrent player actions without race conditions
