2. Document all working functionality with test evidence
3. Catalog all broken or incomplete features with reproduction steps

5. Evaluate performance baseline for state management comparison

## Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing working features remain functional during testing process
- IV2: Testing environment setup doesn't interfere with development workflow
- IV3: Documentation captures both technical and user experience perspectives
